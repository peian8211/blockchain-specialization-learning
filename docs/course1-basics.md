# Course 1: Blockchain Basics
## Key Concepts
- Definition: A decentralized, distributed ledger recording transactions across nodes securely.
- Components: Blocks (data, hash, previous hash), chain structure, consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof of Work - PoW).
- Benefits: Transparency (public visibility), immutability (tamper-proof), trustless operation (no intermediaries).
- Use Case: Bitcoin - enables peer-to-peer payments without banks, validated by miners.

## Notes
- Hashing: Links blocks via cryptographic hashes, ensuring data integrity.
- Mining: Process of validating transactions and adding blocks, rewarded with cryptocurrency.
