# Course 2: Smart Contracts
## Key Concepts
- Definition: Self-executing contracts coded on blockchain (e.g., Ethereum), automating agreements.
- Solidity Basics: Variables (uint, string), functions (public, view), events for logging.
- Execution: Runs on Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), requires gas fees for computation.
- Example: Voting contract - records votes immutably, verifiable by all.

## Notes
- Gas: Measures computational effort, paid in ETH, critical for optimization.
- Security: Contracts must prevent reentrancy attacks (e.g., multiple calls draining funds).
