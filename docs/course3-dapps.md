# Course 3: Decentralized Applications (Dapps)
## Key Concepts
- Definition: Applications with blockchain backend (smart contracts) and frontend (e.g., React), no central control (e.g., Uniswap).
- Structure: Frontend interacts via Web3.js, contracts handle logic, decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS).
- Benefits: User data ownership, resilience against censorship.
- Example: Voting Dapp - enables community governance with transparent results.

## Notes
- Web3.js: Library for connecting frontend to Ethereum nodes.
- Use Case: Decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms like Compound for lending.
